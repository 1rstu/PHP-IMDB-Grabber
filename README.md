# PHP IMDB Grabber

This PHP class enables you to fetch / parse the most important data from IMDB.com.

The script will fail as soon as IMDB changes their layout. Let me know if this happens.

If you want to thank me for this script and the support, you can do this through PayPal (see email bellow) or just buy me something on Amazon (http://www.amazon.de/wishlist/3IAUEEEY6GD20) - **thank you**! :)

## Changes (starting with v5.0.0 alpha):

- **Complete rewrite**
- Added caching for redirects
- Fixed ALL regular expressions according to new IMDB layout
- Added getBudget function
- Added debug option

## Usage

See the imdb.example.php file.

## Example output (of imdb.example.php)
